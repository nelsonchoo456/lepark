How to SSH into Raspberry Pi?
1. Download Raspberry Pi Imager
2. Choose Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), Storage: SD Card, then click on "CHOOSE SD CARD"
3. Choose to customize the OS
    a. Set username and password (pi, password)

    f. Click on "SAVE"
4. ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
    a. Troubleshooting: 
        - If SSH fails, try unplugging the Raspberry Pi from the power source, then plug it back in.
        - ping raspberrypi.local to find out the IP address
        - ssh pi@<ip address>
        - Another way to find out Raspberry Pi's IP address:
            1. arp -a (on Mac)
            2. Find the device with MAC address b8:27:eb. This is usually the Raspberry Pi.
            3. ssh pi@<ip address>
    b. password: password
