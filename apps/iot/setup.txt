How to SSH into Raspberry Pi?
1. Download Raspberry Pi Imager
2. Choose Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), Storage: SD Card, then click on "CHOOSE SD CARD"
3. Choose to customize the OS
    a. Set username and password (pi, password)
    b. Configure wireless LAN (SSID, password) [Make sure WiFi is not 5GHz]
    c. Set locale settings [Timezone: Asia/Singapore, Keyboard: English (US)]
    d. Enable SSH (use password authentication)
    e. Options: Eject media when finished, Enable telemetry
    f. Click on "SAVE"
4. ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
    a. Troubleshooting: 
        - If SSH fails, try unplugging the Raspberry Pi from the power source, then plug it back in.
        - ping raspberrypi.local to find out the IP address
        - ssh pi@<ip address>
        - Another way to find out Raspberry Pi's IP address:
            1. arp -a (on Mac)
            2. Find the device with MAC address b8:27:eb. This is usually the Raspberry Pi.
            3. ssh pi@<ip address>
        - If it says "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!", do `ssh-keygen -R <ip address of raspberry pi>`, then try again.
    b. password: password

How to setup Raspberry Pi for IoT? (make sure you are in SSH)
1. mkdir <folder_name>
2. cd <folder_name>
3. nano .env, set the following:
    a. HUB_IDENTIFIER_NO = <hub_identifier_number>
    b. BACKEND_IP = <backend_ip_address>
    c. BACKEND_PORT = <backend_port>
    d. COM_PORT = <com_port>
        i. If COM_PORT is not known, run `ls /dev/tty*` to find out the COM_PORT
        ii. If there are multiple COM_PORT, try connecting the micro:bit to the Raspberry Pi via USB and see which COM_PORT is being used. (usually /dev/ttyACM0)
    e. CAMERA_IDENTIFIER_NO = <camera_identifier_number>
4. nano hub.py and copy paste the code into it.
5. Run the file by running `python3 hub.py`
6. Camera:
    a. Attach camera to Raspberry Pi
    b. Upload these files into Raspberry Pi: camera.py, utils.py, setup.sh
    c. Install packages by running `sh setup.sh`. Only needed for first setup, and will take around 10min
    d. Run `python3 camera.py` to start the camera
    e. Open http://<rpi_ip_address>:8000 in your browser to view the stream
        i. Find your rpi_ip_address (should be 192.168.xxx.xxx) by running `hostname -I`
    f. Camera detection images are saved in the detection_results folder

How to setup micro:bit?
1. Go to https://makecode.microbit.org/
2. Copy paste the microbit code into the editor
    a. Change the sensorIdentifierNumber (find out from backend)
    b. 
3. Plug the micro:bit to the computer via USB
4. Click on "Download"
5. The micro:bit will reboot
5. The micro:bit is now ready to be used.
